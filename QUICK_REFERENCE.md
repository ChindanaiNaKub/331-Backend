# Quick Reference: Backend Bid Data

## âœ… COMPLETE - Ready for Frontend!

---

## What Was Fixed

Your backend was missing bid data. Now it has:
- âœ… 5 auction items
- âœ… 3 bids per item (with bidder names)
- âœ… 5 successful bids (sold items)
- âœ… Starting prices for all items

---

## Test It

```bash
# Quick test
curl http://localhost:8080/auction-items | jq '.[0]'

# Full test suite
./test_bid_data.sh
```

---

## API Response (Sample)

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "description": "Vintage Rolex Submariner Watch",
  "type": "JEWELRY",
  "startingPrice": 1000.0,
  "bids": [
    {"amount": 1500.0, "bidder": "Alice Johnson", "datetime": "..."},
    {"amount": 1600.0, "bidder": "Bob Smith", "datetime": "..."},
    {"amount": 1700.0, "bidder": "Charlie Davis", "datetime": "..."}
  ],
  "successfulBid": {
    "amount": 1700.0,
    "bidder": "Charlie Davis",
    "datetime": "..."
  }
}
```

## Lab 9 Requirement 1.7

|------------|----------|
| At least 5 AuctionItem | âœ… 5 items |
| Each has 3+ Bid | âœ… 3 bids each |
| 3+ have successful bids | âœ… 5 items sold |

---

## Files Changed

1. `Bid.java` - Added `bidder` field
2. `AuctionItem.java` - Added `startingPrice` field  
3. `InitApp.java` - Added sample data

## Frontend Next Steps

Your frontend (see `FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`) will now automatically show:

- **Card View**: Starting price, sold price, bid count
- **Detail View**: Full bid history with bidders and amounts

**All tests passing! Backend ready! ðŸš€**
